# API advanced
This is a directory that contains advanced tasks on API (Application Programming Interface). In this directory that API advanced tasks will focus on getting responses from the Reddit API. The Reddit API is used here because there’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented.

# Requirements
The following criteria is to be considered when handling the tasks in this directory;

- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- You must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API.
